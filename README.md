# Investment Calculator

A Python tool that calculates compound interest on monthly investments and provides personalized financial advice with what-if scenarios.

## Features

- Calculate future value of monthly investments using compound interest
- Show total invested vs total earnings
- Provide personalized investment advice based on contribution level
- Display "what-if" scenarios:
  - Investing $10 more per month
  - Investing $25 more per month
  - Starting 5 years earlier

## The Power of Compound Interest

This calculator demonstrates how consistent investing and time in the market can build wealth. Small increases in monthly contributions or starting earlier can result in dramatically different outcomes.

## Example Output
```
Monthly Investment: $100
Years: 10
Annual Return: 8%

Results:
- Total Invested: $12,000
- Future Value: $18,294.60
- Profit: $6,294.60
- Return: 52.46%

What-If Scenarios:
- +$10/month = +$1,829 more
- +$25/month = +$4,573 more
- Start 5 years earlier = +$16,309 more
```
